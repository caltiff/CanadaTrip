            cannot
            be staged as scheduled for August 5 – 16, 2020, in its hometown in British Columbia, due to provincial

            The Megatower feels solid and great in the turns, but the suspension isn’t perfect and the build kit isn’t
            particularly good value when compared to most of the other bikes in our Enduro Bike of the Year top ten.
            Santa Cruz introduced the Megatower back in 2019 as its full-blown, ride-just-about-anything enduro machine.

            The US brand offers this “brawler”, as it puts it, in both the ‘C’ and ‘CC’ carbon frames and in a multitude
            of
            builds ranging from the cheapest ‘C R’ seen here all the way up to the range-topping CC XX1 AXS Reserve
            builds
            at £9,499. <a
