      <p id="intro">Whistler Village has been built around a pedestrian-only walkway. Everything from the ski lifts to
        shops, hotels
        and accommodation, places to eat, entertainment and activities can be found within walking distance along the
        attractive Village Stroll. The Village has all the amenities expected of a world-class resort, but is still
        small
        enough for visitors to enjoy its unique mountain culture and friendly atmosphere.</p>
